## Configure the data source in Grafana

[Add a data source](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/add-a-data-source/) by filling in the following fields:

| Field name        | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sentry URL        | Sentry URL to be used. If left blank, the default is `https://sentry.io`.                                                                                              |
| Sentry Org        | Sentry Org slug. Typically this is in the URL, such as `https://sentry.io/organizations/{organization_slug}/`.                                                         |
| Sentry Auth Token | Sentry Auth token. You can generate this from `https://sentry.io/settings/{organization_slug}/developer-settings/`) using the steps specified in the previous section. |

## Configure the data source via provisioning

You can configure data sources to use Grafana’s provisioning system. For more information about how provisioning works, and all of the settings that you can set for data sources, see [Provisioning Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/provisioning/#datasources).

Here is an example for provisioning this data source:

```yml
apiVersion: 1
datasources:
  - name: Sentry
    type: grafana-sentry-datasource
    access: proxy
    orgId: 1
    version: 1
    editable: false
    jsonData:
      url: https://sentry.io
      orgSlug: xxxxxxxxxxxxx
    secureJsonData:
      authToken: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

The query editor allows you to query Sentry, get sentry issues and stats and display them in Grafana dashboard panels. You can choose one of the following query types, to get the relevant data.
